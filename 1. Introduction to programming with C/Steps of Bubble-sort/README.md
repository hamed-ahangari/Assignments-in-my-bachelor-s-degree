# Write codes to print steps of Bubble-sort algorithm
This simple code in C reads some integers from user input, then sorts them using Bubble-sort algorithm.

After each step of comparing and swapping in the Bubble-sort algorithm, `print_array` function would be called to show the array and those swapped indices.

Example of running the code:
